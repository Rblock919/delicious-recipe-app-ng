            -- Recipe Angular Client --

- create prod docker file

- commenting functionality on recipes

- Fix the nutritionValues -> nutrition discrepancy

- powered by in footer for frameworks
- infinite scrolling pagination via apollo docs recipe
- fix query + mutation naming convention
- implement notifications to admins on new recipe submissions via gql subscriptions

- error handling eventually for unauthorized/expired sessions
- upgrade to angular 9 and upgrade lazyloading import statements
- make angular app ping server on init to wake them up faster for deployed envrionments
- test using Ivy
- service/page for users to see their ratings and change them
- non-authenticated gallery page
- a 'learn more' page
- make account related services into separate dropdown on the right
- implement backgrounds on pages (at least outside of containers)
- implement route animations
- consider implementing sort & filter functionality to search page
- removing routing to error component once I'm confident that most errors have been handled and routed to in code sufficiently
- implement route guard when leaving edit users page if changes have been made and not saved
- implement logic so that the application asks the user to log back in if tokens are missing
- add more validation for user submitted info, especially in front end (min + max lengths, disallowed characters for injection attacks)
- simplify/break-up route-guard logic
- tooltip to explain how and where to/not-to copy image address
- eventually implement advanced search with ranges for specific macros and possibly filter on ingredients as well & etc
- modularize some of the logic in edit/approve recipe components to external service
- rejecting recipes can lead to a notifications page where an admin can give a user a reason why they rejected or a notification that their recipe was approved
- save as (.pdf, .txt, etc.) functionality for recipes
- possibly split route-guard into two guards to simplify logic (maybe)
- look for angular equivalent to express-validator (aside from reactive forms validation)
- make sure pages that trigger graphQL queries have a loading icon
- implement validation in reactive angular forms for mongoDB inj characters:   $, }, {
